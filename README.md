## Project 2 :)

A bioinformatics project investigating some caffeine synthases from Camellia sinensis and Coffea arabica.

Draft 1 of Project 2C in 2 formats (Project 2C.ipynb & Project 2C.html)

Fasta file containing protein sequences for 4 caffeine synthases (DXMT1_TCS1A_DXMT2_TCS1E.fasta)

PDB files containing protein structure information for TCS1A (AF-Q9FZN8-F1-model_v2.pdb) and DXMT2 (AF-Q8H0D3-F1-model_v2.pdb)

## Scientific Question: Why do tea leaves (Camellia sinensis) have a different caffeine content than the same amount of coffee beans (Coffea arabica)?
## Scientific Hypothesis: If caffeine synthases, such as TCS1 and CaDXMT1/CaDXMT2, are known to be essential to the caffeine synthesis pathway and known to have similar expression levels in Camellia sinensis and Coffea arabica, respectively, then it is likely that the difference in caffeine content between the two species comes from differences in the enzyme structures.
